Brief instructions for setting up the default 'voicemail' profile.  They
assume you already have Jester installed correctly:

1. Create a MySQL database.

2. Use the included 'voicemail.sql' file to create the necessary tables in the
   new database.

   NOTE: table structure is totally subject to change in future releases,
   you're on your own with that for now!

3. Create an ODBC resource to connect to the database.  See HANDLERS -> odbc at
   'help module data' for more information.

4. If necessary, edit the database configuration settings in
   'profiles/voicemail_admin/conf.lua' and
   'profiles/voicemail_message/conf.lua'

5. Download the Asterisk core sounds and place them in the FreeSWITCH 'sounds'
   directory.

6. From within the Asterisk sounds directory, create a symlink from the digits
   directory to 'time'.  If you're on a Linux/Unix system this should do it:

     ln -s digits time

   This step is necessary for FreeSWITCH's say engine to properly find the
   correct Asterisk sound files.

7. Edit the 'conf/lang/en/en.xml' file to point at the Asterisk sounds, and
   the phrases.xml file found in this profile.  If your sounds are located at
   'sounds/asterisk', then the configuration would look something like this:

   <include>
     <language name="en" sound-path="$${sounds_dir}/asterisk">
       <X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="include" data="$${base_dir}/scripts/jester/profiles/voicemail_phrases.xml"/>
     </language>
   </include>

8. Call Jester from the dialplan, passing the voicemail profile as the
   first sequence argument, and the sequence to call for the second sequence
   argument.  The current sequences depend on having a 'voicemail_context'
   channel variable set up.  The dialplan should look something like this:

    <!-- Jester voicemail setup. -->
    <extension name="jester_voicemail_setup">
      <condition field="destination_number" expression="^jester_voicemail_setup$" break="on-true">
        <action application="set" data="voicemail_context=default"/>
      </condition>
    </extension>
    <!-- Jester voicemail. -->
    <extension name="jester_voicemail">
      <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(\+1|1)?(\d{10})$" break="on-true">
        <action application="set" data="voicemail_mailbox=$2"/>
        <action application="execute_extension" data="jester_voicemail_setup"/>
        <action application="answer"/>
        <action application="sleep" data="1000"/>
        <action application="lua" data="jester/jester.lua voicemail main_greeting"/>
        <action application="hangup"/>
      </condition>
    </extension>
    <!-- Jester voicemail administration. -->
    <extension name="jester_voicemail_admin">
      <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(\+1|1)?(\d{10})$" break="on-true">
        <action application="execute_extension" data="jester_voicemail_setup"/>
        <action application="answer"/>
        <action application="sleep" data="1000"/>
        <action application="lua" data="jester/jester.lua voicemail login_missing_mailbox."/>
        <action application="hangup"/>
      </condition>
    </extension>
