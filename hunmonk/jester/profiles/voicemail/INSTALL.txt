Brief instructions for setting up the default 'voicemail' profile.  They
assume you already have Jester installed correctly:

1. Create a MySQL database.

2. Use the included 'voicemail.sql' file to create the necessary tables in the
   new database.

   NOTE: table structure is totally subject to change in future releases,
   you're on your own with that for now!

3. Create an ODBC resource to connect to the database.  See HANDLERS -> odbc at
   'help module data' for more information.

4. If necessary, edit the database configuration settings in
   'profiles/voicemail_admin/conf.lua' and
   'profiles/voicemail_message/conf.lua'

5. Download the Asterisk core sounds and place them in the FreeSWITCH 'sounds'
   directory.

6. From within the Asterisk sounds directory, create a symlink from the digits
   directory to 'time'.  If you're on a Linux/Unix system this should do it:

     ln -s digits time

   This step is necessary for FreeSWITCH's say engine to properly find the
   correct Asterisk sound files.

7. Edit the 'conf/lang/en/en.xml' file to point at the Asterisk sounds, and
   the phrases.xml file found in this profile.  If your sounds are located at
   'sounds/asterisk', then the configuration would look something like this:

   <include>
     <language name="en" sound-path="$${sounds_dir}/asterisk">
       <X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="include" data="$${base_dir}/scripts/jester/profiles/voicemail/phrases.xml"/>
     </language>
   </include>

8. Call Jester from the dialplan, passing the voicemail profile as the
   first sequence argument, and the sequence to call for the second sequence
   argument.  The current sequences depend on having a 'voicemail_context'
   channel variable set up.  The dialplan should look something like this:

    <!-- Jester voicemail. -->
    <extension name="jester_voicemail">
      <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(\d+)$" break="on-true">
        <action application="answer"/>
        <action application="sleep" data="1000"/>
        <!--
          The arguments to the main_greeting sequence should be:
          <mailbox>[,domain][,group]
          Domain defaults to "default" if not provided.
          If the optional 'group' argument is included, the message will be
          sent to all members of the defined message group.
        -->
        <action application="lua" data="jester/jester.lua voicemail main_greeting $1"/>
        <action application="hangup"/>
      </condition>
    </extension>
    <!-- Jester voicemail administration. -->
    <extension name="jester_voicemail_admin">
      <condition field="destination_number" expression="^(\+1|1)?(\d+)$" break="on-true">
        <action application="answer"/>
        <action application="sleep" data="1000"/>
        <!--
          Setting this value to anything other than an empty string will allow
          the user to log in without password validation.
        -->
        <!-- <action application="set" data="voicemail_login_without_password=true"/> -->
        <!--
          The arguments to the login sequence should be:
          [mailbox][,domain]
          Domain defaults to "default" if not provided.
          You can do ',somedomain' to provide a custom domain with no mailbox
        -->
        <action application="lua" data="jester/jester.lua voicemail login $2"/>
        <action application="hangup"/>
      </condition>
    </extension>
