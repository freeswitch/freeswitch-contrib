This is an experimental profile to provide some basic non-realtime operations
on voicemail data via Jester's socket listener.

Currently the only sequence in the profile is 'clean_deleted_messages', which
removes all database entries and recordings for messages that have been marked
as deleted.  It takes no arguments.

See the code notes at the top of jester/socket.lua for more information on
using this profile via the socket listener.
