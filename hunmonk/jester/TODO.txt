 - add 'cd /path/to/asterisk/sounds; ln -s digits time' to install instructions -- neccessary for say engine to find the number files.
 - help system could use a table of contents feature.
 - the following areas still need to be built out in the comedian mail replica:
   - advanced options
   - mailbox options
   - forwarding a message
   - operations after leaving a message
 - store the mailbox_number and login_type values in a named storage area and
   not the default "custom" storage area.
 - maybe rename the "custom" storage area to "default" now that multiple custom
   storage areas can be defined?
 - figure out how to work the record_trim script into Jester -- perhaps as an
   action in the record module?
 - figure out a more flexible way to implement the "beep" sound in the record
   action -- perhaps change the beep param to a file path, and default to
   tone stream if none is given?
