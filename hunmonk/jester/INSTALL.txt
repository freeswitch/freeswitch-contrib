Jester is relatively easy to install, especially if you have a modern
package-based Linux distribution.  Here are the basic steps:

1. Install Lua (should be readily available from your packaging system)
     eg. 'yum install lua'

2. Install the LuaFileSystem and LuaSocket packages (also probably available
   in your packaging system, they're in the EPEL repository for
   RHEL/CentOS/Fedora, and in the Debian repos as well.
     eg. 'yum install lua-filesystem lua-socket'

   If you can't find these in a package, you can use the LuaRocks system
   (http://luarocks.org), or install from source:
     http://keplerproject.github.com/luafilesystem
     http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket

3. Set your LUA_PATH environment variable to include the FreeSWITCH 'scripts'
   directory.  This is for easy access when you are logged in at the command
   line.  For the bash shell, in a typical installation, it would look like
   this:
     export LUA_PATH=";;/usr/local/freeswitch/scripts/?.lua"

   The two semicolons at the beginning of the path are not a typo!  Lua
   interprets those as 'include my default paths too'.

4. Drop the entire 'jester' directory inside the FreeSWITCH 'scripts'
   directory.  In a typical installation, it would be at:
     /usr/local/freeswitch/scripts/jester

4. Depending on where you install the packages from step 2, you may need to
   fiddle with the LUA_PATH and LUA_CPATH settings in the lua.conf.xml file
   found in the conf/autoload_configs directory of your FreeSWITCH
   installation.
   
   If you're seeing errors at the FreeSWITCH console about not being able
   load "lfs" or "socket", then this is the most likely cause.

   For example, the configuration for LUA_CPATH should be somewhat like this:
     <param name="module-directory" value="/usr/lib64/lua/5.1/?.so"/>
       or
     <param name="module-directory" value="/usr/lib/lua/5.1/?.so"/>
