mod_simple_lcr

Simple in-memory LCR 300/302 redirect server.  No MySQL/PostgreSQL required!

I use this module to perform LCR across 6 or so carriers.  Ratedecks are either flat rate or intra/interstate rated.  Some carriers
treat toll-free caller ID as interstate calling while others do not, so this module handles either scenario. 

This module probably isn't too useful if you are a telco, but for a predictive dialer / call center, it works fine.

Features:
	Hot reload of ratedecks without call interruption
	Small memory footprint
	Lookups only limited by mod_sofia performance

Performance:
	4 CPU VM w/ 4 GB memory
	300 CPS @ 75% CPU utilization
	120 MB memory
	dialplan routing < 100 nanoseconds
	call processing < 500 milliseconds

Notes:
	This performs best with FreeSWITCH from stable branch: version 94664868a8f5bb84b0873e87a5130e39163ccf2d
	I noticed some performance degradation with newer stable/master builds of FreeSWITCH

Testing:
	SIPp load testing scenario is located in sipp
	route_trie test tool is located in test
