    This is a simple FIFO agent login/logout dialplan example. Drop it into the conf/dialplan/default directory in a standard
    FreeSWITCH install or modify it as you see fit.

    These are "on hook" agents, i.e. the phone rings when a call comes in; agents don't sit and wait on the phone.
    Dial 6* plus the FIFO number to log in.  Example: 61* to log into "FIFO1"
    Dial 6# plus the FIFO number to log out. Example: 61# to log out of "FIFO1"
    NOTE: I added 6** as an alternative to logging out b/c some phone dialplans don't like 6#...

    By default there are ten slots. You can mix, match, add, etc. as you see fit.
    NOTE: There isn't any error checking, so the the system will say that the user is logged in or out no matter what!
    NOTE: I have added an option to use group_confirm so that your agents have to press 1 to accept. This is useful in the case where an agent is a cell phone or other phone that has voicemail.

    Send a caller to the queue by transferring to 610[0-9]; 6101 corresponds to FIFO1, 6102 to FIFO2, etc.

    To see that your user did indeed login go to the FS CLI and type "fifo list" and it will show you everything.
    Use "fifo list_verbose" to see LOTS of information about the FIFO queues.
