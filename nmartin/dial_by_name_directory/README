dial_by_name_directory.xml is a phrase macro for the beginning of the directory app.
dial_by_name_directory.js is the directory app itself.

Place dial_by_name_directory somewhere in conf/lang/en/ maybe in a folder named directory?
edit en.xml in conf/lang/en to include the directory/ directory (uh-oh, bad name)

drop dial_by_name_directpry.js in scripts/

in the dial plan, execute the dial by name directory like:

<extension name="dial_by_name">
	<condition field="destination_number" expression="^6000$">
		<action application="javascript" data="dial_by_name_directory.js" />
	</condition>
</extension>

or, from an IVR:

<entry action="menu-exec-app" digits="9" param="javascript dial_by_name_directory.js"/>
