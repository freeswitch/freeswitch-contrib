What is it?

mod_fastsms is a FreeSWITCH module that can be used to send Short Message Service (SMS)
text messages via the FastSMS web service.

Configuration

A template fastsms.conf.xml is included, you will need to edit the auth tag to put in
the information you get from the FastSMS service.

As far as your dialplan goes, you can add something like this:

<extension name="fastsms">
  <condition field="destination_number" expression="^1200$">
    <action application="fastsms" data="15145551212 Limit this bit of text to 160 characters. It's your message."/>
  </condition>
</extension>

You can optionally define an originator (who the message appears to come from), in your
directory, add this line:
	<variable name="fastsms_originator" value="Mr. Bob's Server"/>

and reloadxml.

That's about it! Just copy the fastsms.conf.xml to your conf/autoload_configs and make
the changes appropriately, copy this directory to freeswitch/src/mod/applications/mod_fastsms
edit freeswitch/modules.conf and add a line "applications/mod_fastsms" then rebuild
FreeSWITCH.
