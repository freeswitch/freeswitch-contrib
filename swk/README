This Software is licensed under the MPL.

REQUIREMENTS:

To Use:
Flash9 or Flash10 
PHP 5
AMFPHP http://www.amfphp.org/
FreeSWITCH ESL PHP Extensions
And of course a WebServer

To Develop:
All of the Above
Adobe Flex Development Environment. (This is available from Adobe's website in both paid and free formats.)


To Install: 

Install AMFPHP as per http://www.amfphp.org/docs/installingamfphp.html
Rename the 'amfphp' directory to feeder. This is done to avoid robot scanners, bu I am sure that eventually they'll start looking for that.

copy the freeswitch.php file into the AMFPHP services directory.

make the files in amf-test1/bin-debug available on your webserver and point a browser at it.

copy the php/xml_curl directory to your webserver 

make sure you have mod_xml_curl built and installed and enabled
	uncomment it in the modules.conf in your source tree
	uncomment it in your modules.conf.xml in the conf/autoload_configs/modules.conf.xml


edit the gateway_url param in conf/autoload_configs/xml_curl.conf.xml to enabale the directory binding
EXAMPLE:
	<param name="gateway-url" value="http://localhost/xml_curl/directory.php" bindings="directory"/>


rename conf/directory/default.xml to conf/directory/default.xml.NOLOAD
	this is no longer required as we are now loading the directory using xml_curl


If you are developing in flex you need to load the swf from your development webserver so that it can properly locate the service. 

Any questions, feel free to find me as SwK via IRC at #freeswitch on irc.freenode.net or krice AT freeswitch DOT org


TODO:
Fix Groups and Group Editing
Fix Conference Controls
Rework PHP Class Files for both the amfphp service and the xml_curl there is no need to maintain these seperately as they share a fair ammount of code
anything else I can come up with
