This Software is licensed under the MPL.

REQUIREMENTS:

To Use:
Flash9 or Flash10 
PHP 5
AMFPHP http://www.amfphp.org/
FreeSWITCH ESL PHP Extensions
And of course a WebServer

To Develop:
All of the Above
Adobe Flex Development Environment. (This is available from Adobe's website in both paid and free formats.)


To Install: 

Install AMFPHP as per http://www.amfphp.org/docs/installingamfphp.html
Rename the 'amfphp' directory to feeder. This is done to avoid robot scanners, bu I am sure that eventually they'll start looking for that.

copy the freeswitch.php file into the AMFPHP services directory.

make the files in amf-test1/bin-debug available on your webserver and point a browser at it.

If you are developing in flex you need to load the swf from your development webserver so that it can properly locate the service. 

Any questions, feel free to find me as SwK via IRC at #freeswitch on irc.freenode.net
