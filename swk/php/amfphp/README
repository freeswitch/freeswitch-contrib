AMF-PHP FreeSwitch Service

Copy the freeswitch.php file to your AMF-PHP services directory

the flex file goes in the normal spot... this is not dynamically configured so you'll have to edit a few things to get it right

TODO: Dynamically detect where the AMF Feed is (ie: dont hardcode the URL)
TODO: Make the UI better Looking
TODO: Add some form of user management
TODO: CDR Viewer
TODO: Anything else I think I might want to add here

Feel Free to submit patches It would be nice to figure out a good way to support as much of the API as possible via ESL and add things
like basic Server monitoring
