libmsn is a C++ library for Microsoft's MSN Messenger service. It provides a high-level 
interface that allows an application to access instant messaging features with ease.

libmsn is licensed under the terms of the GPL.  Please see the file `COPYING' included
with the distribution for more information.

Whats New?
----------
In 4.0:    libmsn 4.0 was refactored to support MSNP15 protocol.
           Many features were added to this version, like offline messaging, file transfer with
           preview, nugdes, custom emoticons, ink and winks sending and receiving, avatar support,
           address book management with soap actions, and so on.

In 3.2:    With the release of libmsn 3.2 comes support for multiple simultaneous connections.  The
           callback mechanism has been refactored so that it is easy to distinguish between each
           connection's callbacks.  A large number of bug fixes have also been rolled in to this
           release.
In 3.1.1:  libmsn 3.1.1 is primarily a bug fix release.  Changes include fixing up the #include's
           so that it compiles cleanly on a wider range of platforms, working file transfer
           support and improved error handling.
In 3.1:    libmsn 3.1 brings support for server-side groups for managing buddies.  It also
           features rewritten network code that should help reduce CPU usage, and the amount
           of time spent waiting for network data.
In 3.0b2:  3.0b2 tidies up the external API to be more consistent with the rest of libmsn.
           The build system has also been adjusted so that the same program, msntest, is
           built.
