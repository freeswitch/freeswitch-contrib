This directory contains software for outputting a phonebook
suitable for download to a Grandstream phone.  It is generated
at startup and updated whenever a reloadxml occurs.

gs_phonebook.lua goes into the FreeSWITCH scripts directory.

Configuration fragments look something like:

  conf/autoload_configs/lua.conf.xml

    <param name="startup-script" value="gs_phonebook.lua"/>

  Grandstream

    Phonebook XML Download:      YES, TFTP
    Phonebook XML Server Path:   <IP address of freeswitch server>
    Phonebook Download Interval: <desired interval ... e.g. 240>

and assumes that a tftp server has been configured.  Obviously
other arrangements can be used (e.g. http).

The script uses LuaXml which is available from:

  http://www.viremo.de/LuaXML/

typical installation has:

  /usr/local/lib/lua/5.1/LuaXML_lib.so
  /usr/local/share/lua/5.1/LuaXml.lua

Tested using FreeSWITCH SVN 13988 running on FreeBSD 6.4.
