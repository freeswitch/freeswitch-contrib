mod_xml_odbc_simple

A simple variant of mod_xml_odbc, without the templating stuff. This module is especially nice
if you have your users defined in 'flat' tables where each attr, param and variable is simply
a column in the result of your query.



Todo:

- Get rid of all memory leaks (valgrind)
- Make it possible to define an odbc-dsn per query - should be easy with this switch_cache_db stuff
