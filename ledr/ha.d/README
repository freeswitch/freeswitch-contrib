NOTE: THIS HA CONFIG IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT !!

That said, here's a little howto to get heartbeat going (assuming you're using CentOS).

Follow the following steps on both your master- and slave servers:

* Install some dependencies:

yum install heartbeat heartbeat-pils heartbeat-stonith

* Copy the files in this directory to /etc/ha.d:

for i in authkeys ha.cf haresources resources.d; do cp -avr $i /etc/ha.d; done

* Edit ha.cf and haresources on both hosts so the hostnames are correct (equal to uname -n).

* Make sure your Sofia SIP profile(s) are correctly defined in haresources.

* Set the correct configuration parameters for fs_cli in resources.d/FSSofia

* Configure the floating IP in your FS Sofia SIP profile itself.

* Make sure heartbeat starts at startup:

chkconfig heartbeat on

* Start heartbeat:

service heartbeat start

* Enjoy ! :)
