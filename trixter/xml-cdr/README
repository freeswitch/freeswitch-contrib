To use this you need to have the mod_xml_cdr loaded and configured.

If you use either errLogDir or logDir then make sure that the directories
exist.  In the case of logDir the original code appended "/xml_cdr" onto
the value, so I do that as well.  If logDir is set but empty (value="")
it will use the FreeSWITCH default log dir and appent "/xml_cdr" onto
that.

    <!-- the credentials we may optionally use when POSTing ->
    <param name="cred" value="user:pass"/>
    <!-- url to log to -->
    <param name="url" value="http://myhost/cdr.php"/>
    <!-- how many times we retry not counting the inital try -->
    <param name="retries" value="2"/>
    <!-- how many seconds before we try again -->
    <param name="delay" value="120"/>
    <!-- this is where we log failed POSTs to the webserver -->
    <param name="errLogDir" value="/usr/local/freeswitch/log/xml_cdr_errors"/>

<!-- optional: if not present we do not log every record to disk -->
<!-- per original code base /xml_cdr is appended to the directory name -->
<param name="logDir" value="/usr/local/freeswitch/log"/>
