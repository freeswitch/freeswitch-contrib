This is an example that will respond to mod_xml_curl requests for information.
It uses modules, which are contained in the modules subdirectory.  If a module
(any file ending in .php) is in the dir it will be loaded.  If it registers
to handle a specific type of xml_curl request, that will be passed to the function named.
If you dont have a module for a specific type of data, for example directory, then
a 404 will be returned to FreeSWITCH.  

The module nature allows you to more easily turn on/off different components.  

Its a template based system, which relies on someone authenticating, such as with
.htaccess.  Their username is used in this default example for their configuration
files.  This allows for multiple switches to identify themselves uniquely, as well
as giving you the ability to have different templates for different switches.



PREREQUISITES
You will need to get smarty from http://smarty.php.net to make this work

If you install it globally, edit your php.ini to make the Smarty/libs dir as part
of the search path, otherwise add the following to curlrouting.php near the other 
ini_set line.  Adjust it to suit your particular setup.

ini_set("include_path",".:/usr/local/lib/php:/usr/share/php:./Smarty-2.6.18/libs");



You also must create a directory named templates_c where you install this, its a smarty
requirement for caching templates.  This directory *must* be writable by the webserver
or Smarty will not properly operate.
