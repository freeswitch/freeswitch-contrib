Better address book integration.   Right now the integration is pretty lame to say the least, you cannot lookup contacts or do much in the way of editing them. I think a nice interm solution would be a control + f support to find a contact to atleast make outgoing calls.  Right now contact plugins can add right click menus but maybe making a more central way for them to add right click options so they don't have to do so much work would be better.
Volume control / gain.   Right now you can use the system volume to adjust things but it would be nice to have this built into the GUI and also have a gain option.  Gain would require changes to portaudio to support it most likely (although should be decently simple) or using set_audio_level.
Plugin control, ability to enable or disable plugins from the options menu.
Figure out a way to sort codecs, a draggable combo box may work well.
